        <div>
          <h3 id="2">2) Do you take any customers?</h3>
          <p>We support all regions except the US and Australia. Sorry if you’re in one of those two countries! </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 id="3">3) What crypto currencies do you support? </h3>
          <p>The big 3; Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dash. We’re currently working on support for ERC-20 compliant tokens and hope
            to have good news soon!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 id="4">4) Can I play with fiat currency?</h3>
          <p>No, sorry. Cryptocurrencies only</p>
        </div>

        <div id="5">
          <h3 >5) What are the fees? </h3>
          <p>Absolutely minimal and we’re transparent about it: 1%
            <br> Most poker sites take 2.5 - 6% as the ‘rake’, and use complicated structures that make it near impossible to
            compare the actual fees.
            <br> We only take 1% rake. Clear and simple so you can enjoy playing.
            <br>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 id="6">6) How do I fund my account and start playing? </h3>

            have a functioning wallet, then please go to Question 7.

            <li>Once your funds arrive, choose your buy in amount, sit down and enjoy playing!

        <div>
          <h3 id="8">8) I don’t have a Wallet yet. What is it and how do I get one?</h3>
          <p>A cryptocurrency wallet is a secure digital wallet used to store, send, and receive digital currency like Bitcoin.
            Cryptocurrency itself is not actually “stored” in a wallet. Instead, a private key (secure digital code known
            only to you and your wallet) is stored that shows ownership of a public key (a public digital code connected
            to a certain amount of currency). So your wallet stores your private and public keys, allows you to send and
            receive coins, and also acts as a personal ledger of transactions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most coins have an official wallet or a few officially recommended third party wallets. If you are new to cryptocurrency,
            then we recommend getting started with those on dash.org. DashCore has InstantSend capability

          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>DashCore</li>
            <li>Exodus</li>
            <li>Jaxx</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Once you’re familiar with how wallets operate, you can explore a wide range of different wallets which offer varying pros
            and cons.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Some software offered as a wallet is actually malware trying to take advantage of those willing to download and
            install unofficial software off the internet. Never trust mining or wallet software that comes from a source
            that you don’t know and trust. Start with well worn solutions like the ones that are officially endorsed..

          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Never share your wallet password or private key and never enter your password or private key anywhere (unless
            you are accessing your wallet via private key and password). To send coins and receive coins you only need to
            share your public wallet address (your “public key”).

          </p>

        <div>
          <h3 id="9">9) Where can I get cryptocurrency?</h3>

          </ol>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 id="10">10) If I have a problem, how do I get in contact?</h3>

          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 id="11">11) How do I cash out?</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to your Wallet and generate and copy a Receiving Address
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>Paste the Receiving Address and click ‘Confirm & Withdraw’
            </li>
            <li>Wait for your confirmation and you’re done!

          </ol>
          <p>
            'Cash Out' transfers are immediately pushed to the network. Unlike other sites which like to hold onto your money as long
            as possible, we harness the power of cryptocurrencies to ensure you receive your money ASAP.
